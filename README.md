# Titanic-data-set-Chi-square-Test
I will explain to you how you can test two categorical columns ( being alone and surviving) and (being male or female with surviving) in Titanic data set
to determine if they are dependent on each other (i.e. correlated). 
I used chi-square (commonly written as Ï‡2) to identfy correlation and to make descision either to accept or refuse the null hypothesis
